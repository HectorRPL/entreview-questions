### My mistakes were:
    -   import user in index.html,
        only need main.js
    -   don set ".js" in the 
        "import User from './user.js';" declaration.
        I had put:
        "import User from './user';"
        This is not angular or react, the interpreter
        o someone doing this work for you.
        When is vanilla javascript you need
        to be very exactly.
    -   WTF is "nomodule" attribute in script tag?
    -   import User from './user.js'; remember is
    -   default export", and you can set your
        own creativity name
    -   CORS problems when use import/export in
        simple html web page.

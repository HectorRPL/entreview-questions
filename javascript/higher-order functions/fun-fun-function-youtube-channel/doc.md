### Higher-order functions - Part 1 of Functional Programming in JavaScript

* Functional Programming
* Less bugs in less time
* Re-use more code
* Functions are values

    var triple = function tripe(x) {
        return x * 3
    }
    var waffle = trie
    waffle(3)

* Composition put a function in another function. Small functions in a bigger functions
